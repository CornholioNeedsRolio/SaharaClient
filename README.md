# SaharaClient

A client I made when I was bored, feel free to make pull requests, there is a big chance I will add it to my client... as long as it isnt some backdoor or some bad code. If it is I'm gonna burn you alive, I don't need backdoors anywhere close to this client. Also this can be used as a base for your private modules, on your private fork.

Btw please don't judge some parts of the code, I wanted it do be done.
